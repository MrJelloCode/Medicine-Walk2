            <h1>Plot of <span>Medicine Walk</span></h1>
            <p>
This story introduces the main characters, Frank Starlight and Eldon Starlight, in the wilderness of Canada. This story builds background on Franklin’s complicated relationship with his father. Franklin agrees to take Eldon into the wilderness to have a “warrior’s death”. Along the way, Eldon begins sharing painful stories from his past, including trauma, addiction, and personal failures. Near the end of their journey, Eldon finally reveals the truth about Franklin’s mother and the circumstances surrounding her death, giving Franklin a complete background on his father’s past. After the confession, Eldon passes away, and Franklin carries out his father’s final requests. The emotional tension eases as Franklin begins to process everything he has learned. Franklin heads back toward the life he left behind, carrying with him a new understanding of his identity and his past.

                <li><b>Eldon Starlight</b> — Frank’s alcoholic biological father.</li>
                <li><b>The Old Man (Bunky)</b> — the man who raised Frank, a quiet and wise figure.</li>

        <h3>Rising Action</h3>
        <ul id="RisingAction">
            <li>Eldon, dying of liver failure, sends for Frank and asks him to take him into the wilderness so he can be buried in the “warrior way” in a special place from his past.</li>
            <li>Frank agrees, and the two set out on a physically and emotionally difficult journey into the backcountry.</li>

            <li>This moment is emotionally charged and represents the breaking point in their relationship, where truths can no longer be avoided.</li>

        <h3>Resolution</h3>

            <li>Eldon passes away, and Frank buries him as promised.</li>
            <li>Frank leaves the burial site alone but with a new understanding of his own identity, his heritage, and the complexities of his father’s life.</li>
